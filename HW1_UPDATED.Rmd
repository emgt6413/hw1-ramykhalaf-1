# Requirement 4

```{r}
x <- 5  # radius of a circle
x
```

For a circle with the radius `r x` and its area is about `r 3.14 * x^2`.

# Requirement 5

This is done in RStudio

# Requirement 6
      
```{r}
# my_variable <- 10
# my_varıable
# Error: object 'my_varıable' not found
```

This is since the letter "i" in both are different (one has the dot and the other does not); as such, the second object is not available in the code to realize its value. The variable is not available in order to be called

# Requirement 7

Showing R markdown in a new menu (source: https://twitter.com/JosephTumber/status/1350185715976470531?s=20). This is very helpful since I like to use many windows for better productivity.

# Requirement 8

I would say the most difficult for me would have to be p-value fishing, since often in our research we are given a dataset and often we have to "fish" for what to look into the data. I would also like to say that a lot of times in reviewing of paper in journals, I notice that partial publication seems to be evident. Where not the entire story is detailed in attempts to get a "better" publication. This is very unethical.
